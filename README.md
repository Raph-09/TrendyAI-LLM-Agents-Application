# TrendyAI Documentation

## Overview
TrendyAI is an application that leverages AI to fetch and present trending topics in the tech domain. It uses the crewai library, Google Generative AI, and Streamlit for the web interface. This application enables users to input a tech-related topic and get a concise report on the latest trends related to that topic.

## Code Explanation

### Imports

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from langchain.agents import Tool
import streamlit as st
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from dotenv import find_dotenv, load_dotenv
```

### Environment Setup

```python
dotenv_path = find_dotenv()
load_dotenv(dotenv_path)
```

### Large Language Model Initialization

```python
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
        model="gemini-pro",
        verbose=True,

    )
```

### Search Tool Initialization

```python
search_tool = TavilySearchResults()
```

### Creating Agents

        tools=[search_tool],
        llm=llm
    )
    writer = Agent(
        role='Content Writer',

    )
    return researcher, writer
```

### Creating Tasks

```python
def create_tasks(researcher, writer, topic):
    task1 = Task(
        description= """Search the web for trending topics on {topic}. Analyze posts, discussions and social media threads to get comprehensive
        idea about it""",
        agent=researcher,
        expected_output=f'''Provide a detailed report on trending topics and discussions on {topic}'''
    )

    )
    return task1, task2
```

### Running the Crew Process

```python
def run_crew_process(topic):
    
    researcher, writer = create_agents(llm, search_tool, topic)
    task1, task2 = create_tasks(researcher, writer, topic)
    
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[researcher, writer],
        tasks=[task1, task2],
        verbose=2
    )
    result = crew.kickoff()
    return result
```

### Streamlit UI

        st.markdown(f"<style>{source_des.read()}</style>",unsafe_allow_html=True)
    
    topic = st.text_input("Enter any tech related topic:")

    if st.button("Get what is trending"):
        if topic:
            with st.spinner('Geting the topics...'):
                result = run_crew_process(topic)
                st.success("Process completed!")
                st.write("### Result")
                st.write(result)
